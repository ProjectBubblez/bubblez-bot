# Bubblez bot
The bubblez bot, that's it

## Environment file
The environment file is called ".env" and needs to have 3 things.  
`DTOKEN` is the token used to login to discord.  
`BTOKEN` is the token used to login to bubblez.  
`STOKEN` is the token used to login to the secure bubblez api.  
An optional environment field is `DEBUG` which shouldn't be specified in production and specified as `true` when testing.
